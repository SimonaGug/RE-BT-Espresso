# RE:BT-Espresso, Representation Exploitation of BT-Espresso for Behavior Trees Learned from Robot Demonstrations 

IMPORTANT: The repo is not clean in the slightest as it is divulging near deadlines. This will be cited as "`open-source`" in the sense that all code can be audited/read. I personally find pseudo code within papers more difficult to read than poorly written real code. If you are looking for the algorithm described within the paper, you will want to look at `BehaviorTreeDev/BehaviorTreeBuilder.py` starting with function `re_bt_espresso`.

## Install
1. Clone repo
2. Install python3 dependencies below (you can create a  python3 [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and activate it if you would like first)
3. Fix [pyeda library error](#pyeda-literal-error)

## Running Experiments
In the top level directory, to run all experiments:
`python3 run_experiments.py [-r, --recolor] [-c --config] [-m --multiprocess]`
where `-r` is an optional flag to also re-color the trees, `-c` allows a specification of a single experiment, and `-m` flag runs all experiments in parallel. By default, all experiments are run.

Autogenerated usage:
```
usage: run_experiments.py [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-r] [-m]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Name of experiment config json, without this flag it will recurse though all experiments
  -r, --recolor         Run recoloring of all trees
  -m, --multiprocess    Run experiments in ||
```

## Experiment Pipeline
1. DataSim
2. BuildBT
    * Normalize
    * Hotencode
    * [OPTIONAL] SVMSMOTE Upsampling
    * Learn and Build BT
3. [OPTIONAL] ReColorBT
4. RunResults

### Pyeda Literal Error
There is a bug is Pyeda library that also need to be fixed. See [#17](https://github.com/interaction-lab/BTFromSARDemostration/issues/17) for fix.
